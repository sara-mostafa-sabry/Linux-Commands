The system admins team of xFusionCorp Industries has set up some scripts on jump host that run on regular intervals and perform operations on all app servers in Stratos Datacenter. To make these scripts work properly we need to make sure the thor user on jump host has password-less SSH access to all app servers through their respective sudo users (i.e tony for app server 1). Based on the requirements, perform the following:


Set up a password-less authentication from user thor on jump host to all app servers through their respective sudo users.

How to Setup Passwordless SSH Login?

1- Check for existing SSH key pair.
ls -al ~/.ssh/id_*.pub

if there are no keys


2- Generate a new SSH key pair.
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@domain.com"

3- Copy the public key
ssh-copy-id remote_username@server_ip_address

if ssh-copy-id  is not available
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh remote_username@server_ip_address "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && chmod 700 ~/.ssh && cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"


4- Login to your server using SSH keys
ssh remote_username@server_ip_address
